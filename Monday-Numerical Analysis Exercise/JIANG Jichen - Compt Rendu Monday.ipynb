    "In many applications we are required to find the roots of equations, that is solve an equation of the form $f(x) = 0$.\n",
    "Note that solving $f(x) = g(x)$ is equivalent to solving $h(x) = 0$, where $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$.\n",
    "We can easily solve linear equations: $ax + b = 0 \\Longrightarrow x = -b/a$.\n",
    "Also we can solve quadratic equations: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\Longrightarrow x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n",
